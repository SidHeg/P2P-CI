	Description: 'Peer to peer text file transfer. All the peers will register the text files available with them to a centralized server. Whenever any client wants any of these text files, they first ask the server. The server provides the information as to which peer has the requested text file. The required file is then transfered on p2p connection between the client which requested for the text file and the peer which had it.'
